What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

This assignment went generally alright, although it was tricky to work with multiple classes for the first time. It worked well to establish the attributes first, and then consider which behaviors concerned the attributes of each class.

One thing I had trouble with was choosing a class for the more complicated methods. I was especially confused by the ones that required the resale shop to determine if a computer was in the inventory, but then needed to update information about the computer. I ended up assigning those methods to the Computer class, which means a computer's information can be updated even if it's not in the shop inventory, so I'm not sure if this was the most useful way to do it.

I found it helpful to discuss the assignment in class and hear other students' approaches, and I would recommend that future students do the same.
